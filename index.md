# Welcome to the Halo Wars Modding wiki!

{: .important }
This wiki is a work in progress. If the content you're looking for isn't documented yet, we recommend joining the [Halo Wars Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/GuvUCgqz8d) for help and guidance.

This is the home for all documentation on modding Halo Wars: Definitive Edition.
These docs will cover everything from the basics like modifying a unit, to rigging and importing new models and beyond.

### What's Possible?

Currently, the main things we are able to create and edit are:
* Objects (single units, props, buildings)
* Squads (groups of single units)
* Leaders (both playable leaders, and in-game leader units)
* Techs (unit and power upgrades)
* Misc game settings (camera, team colors)

Some things that can only be modified to a limited degree are:
* Maps
  * Objects and squads can be placed on existing maps
  * Skyboxes and terrain textures can be edited
* Scripts
  * Used to create new missions/gamemodes/leader-powers (more research is required still)
* GUI/HUD
  * Can be edited with the right tools (more research is required still)
