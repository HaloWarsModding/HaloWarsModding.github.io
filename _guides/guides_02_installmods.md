## How to Install Mods Manually

*If you are updating from a previous version, delete the previous version before installing.

Downloading a mod will provide you with an archive, usually .rar or .zip. Extract it with WinRAR, 7zip, or an equivalent program.

  -If you are using the Steam version, you may place the "LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6" folder anywhere on your PC. 

  -If you have the windows store version, then you must put it here:

    C:\Users\*YourUsername*\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.BulldogThreshold_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState

Open the "LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6" folder, then open "ModData" and copy the address/path. 
  
  -If no ModData folder is present, copy the address/path of the mod folder itself instead.

Then, go to:

C:\Users\*YourUsername*\AppData\Local\Halo Wars

Right click, create a .txt file and name it "ModManifest".

Open ModManifest and paste in the address that was copied.

Save ModManifest, and you're done

Example of the mod folder path:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\HaloWarsDE\Medstar's HaloWarsDE Mod Manager\HWDE Mods\LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6\ModData

## How to Install Mods Using Medstar's Mod Manager

Downloading a mod will provide you with an archive, usually .rar or .zip. Extract it with WinRAR, 7zip, or an equivalent program.

  -The extracted mod folder used in this guide is titled "LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6"
  
If the mod page did not specify whether the mod is compatible with the mod manager, you may easily check this yourself by opening the mod folder. If you see a ModData folder, then the mod is compatible and you may continue following this guide. If not, then check out the manual installation guide instead.

Download and install Medstar's Mod Manager

Follow the instructions given in the description of the Mod Manager

Place the "LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6" folder in the "HWDEMods" folder

Example of the mod folder path:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\HaloWarsDE\Medstar's HaloWarsDE Mod Manager\HWDE Mods\LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6\ModData

## How to Uninstall Mods

All you have to do is either delete the ModManifest.txt or to rename, move or delete the mod folder. The Mod Manager allows you to choose to play vanilla at any time, so you do not need to uninstall mods to play vanilla.
