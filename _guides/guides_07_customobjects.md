# Custom Objects <span class="label label-blue">Work in Progress</span>
{: .no_toc }

Objects.xml is a massive file containing every single object in the game, such as units, structures, and projectiles. By following this guide, youâ€™ll learn the basics as how to create the foundations for all sorts of custom objects, as well as learn about how to fix some of the common issues that may arise when creating these custom objects.
If you'd like to jump to a particular section, then you can use the table of contents found below.

# Shared Attributes
There are several tags in the game that are important and also used by various kinds of objects. For a more in depth explanation for what the many various other tags within objects.xml do, check the [Objects documentation](docs/objects) for more info, as this guide will only go over the most important things among these tags.

Here is a brief overview of the various most commonly shared tags:

<!--`<Obstruction Radius>`

The Obstrution Radius handles the collision box for any given object, and has a major factor in unit maneuverability.-->

`<Visual>`

The Visual is fairly straightforward; it contains the file path that the object will use to retrieve its model and animations, or its visuals.

`<Hardpoint>`

Hardpoints are used by all sorts of turret-like objects attached to structures and units. They are also used by certain air units like the Pelican to control wings and other similar parts. These are used to help distinguish turrets from a model, and allow said turrets to turn independently from the main model. They also assist infantry in that they allow them to attack while moving.

`<Hitpoints>`

Hitpoints dictate the **BASE** health of an object. Various external factors such as `techs.xml` and `aidifficultysettings.xml` can then modify this base value and cause it to be different ingame.

<!--`<ObjectClass>`

The Object Class dictates what kind of object that particular asset is, and it enables and disables various tags depending on the input. Making something use an object class that its not meant to can have unexpected results!

`<MovementType>`

An Object's Movement Type determines how it moves around the map, whether it flies, stays on the ground, or if it crawls over terrain. This often works alongside an objects `<PhysicsInfo>`.-->

`<Tactics>`

An object can't attack without tactics. It handles all of an object's weapons and the damage they deal, as well as what enenmies they should use which weapons on. It also handles supportive abilites, such as self healing, cyclops repairing, and passive projectile deflections.

# Custom Units
Custom Units are composed of several components that are spread across a few files, these additional files are: `squads.xml` and `techs.xml`, though every unit will additionally require a `.tactics` file. It sounds like a lot of work, but by copying existing units and modifying them from there, you may find that it is much easier then it sounds. For this guide, we'll be creating a marine that only fires the rocket launcher. In order to do this, we'll need to modify 4 different files: `Objects.xml`, `Squads.xml`, and the object's `<Visual>` and `<Tactics>` files.

## Making your custom marine variant in `Objects.xml`

To start, We'll need to make our own version of the marine. First open your text editor of choice, and use the search function to find the entry for `<unsc_inf_marine_02>`. Once you find it, copy its entire object and paste it underneath. We'll then need to change the name to something else, so change the name of your duplicate object to `unsc_inf_marine_03`. If you don't do this, the game will crash on startup. This is what it should look like at this point.

From here, we'll need to change the files being referenced in the `<Visual>` and `<Tactics>`. Scroll to where you see the line for the visual, and change the path to `unsc\infantry\marine_01\marine_02.vis`. You will also need to do this for the tactics `unsc_inf_marine_02` If it looks like how it is in this screenshot, then you've done it correctly.

Now we're done in `objects.xml`, we'll need to follow the file path that the visual links to in order to get to the `.vis` file.

## Modifying the appearance in the `<Visual>`

In the visual, we'll be changing the weapon they hold. Thankfully, this is made easier by the marine's use of what we call *Optional Attachments*. In this case, all you would need to do is use the search function, and have it replace every instance of `<meshEnable>optionalAssaultRifle</meshEnable>` with `<meshEnable>optionalRocketLauncher</meshEnable>`. While this method won't work for most other units, we'll be using it here to keep this guide short. With that, we're already done in the visual file. Now we're going over to the tactics, and changing it so that they only use the rocket launcher.

## Changing up the unit's attacks in `<Tactics>`

Theres a lot of tweaking that could be done in tactics, though to keep things simple we will change very little. First, we will swap out the assault rifle projectile by using the search function to replace `<Projectile>fx_proj_rifle_01</Projectile>` with `<Projectile>fx_proj_rocket_01</Projectile>`. Then, scroll down to the actions section and look for `<Anim>AssaultRifleAttack</Anim>` and replace it with `<Anim>RocketAttack</Anim>`. With that

## Adding your marine to the marine squad in `Squads.xml`

<!--`<PhysicsInfo>`/`<PhysicsReplacementInfo>`

Physics are one of the most defining attributes of any particular unit, as the physics applied can drastically affect how the unit visually moves on the battlefield. also controls how wheels and treads function on the craft. Its not a rare sight to see a particlar set of physics used by only a single unit. The Warthog is a good example of such, where its physics allow it to drive around erratically and generally handle much like a Warthog does in the mainline games.-->

# Custom Structures
Custom Structures are spread across similar files much like Custom Units, though they do not require entries in `squads.xml`. For this guide, we'll be creating a custom barracks that can train warthogs.

# Custom Hooks
Custom Hooks are a bit easier then Custom Structures, as you don't need to worry about making them available to train through `techs.xml`. For this guide, we'll be creating a custom sentinel shop that can train hornets and banshees.

# Custom Scenery Objects
Scenery Objects are by far the easiest to set up, as the only external file usually needed for them would be a `<visual>` (which most objects have anyway). For this guide, we'll turn a rebel turret into a decorative scenery object.

# Custom Projectiles
Custom Projectiles are fairly straightforward to create, and have a fair few settings to experiment with to adjust the projectile as you wish. Don't forget that some settings for the projectile are also controlled in the `.tactics` file as well! For this guide, we'll be creating a custom version of the plasma grenade that can home in on targets.

## Custom Particles
Custom Particle effects can be very complex, and so we instead insist that you check out the [Particle File documentation](_docs/pfx) for an in-depth explanation on how these files can be customized.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues
Often when setting up custom objects, you may run into all sorts of various issues ranging from game crashes to being unable to train your custom object. This section aims to fix to help you find a fix these issues and will be expanded on as more issues arise and are solved.
These troubleshooting options are set up with custom units in mind, though many of them can be applied to other object types. 

**Game Crashes before main menu loads**

- There's an error in your `Objects.xml` and/or `Techs.xml` that causes the file to not format correctly. Ensure all brackets are enclosed and that no objects share completely identical names.

**Game Crashes at match start (when unit is started spawned in)**/**Game Crashes when unit is trained**

- There is most likely an issue within the object's `.vis`. Ensure that there isn't an infinite loop of modelrefs, as this is the most probable cause. Sometimes this crash can rarely come from very specific animations under very specific circumstances. Its not well known as to what this affects, though one known example would be the `RotaryMachinegunAttack` animation from the Warthog being used on a Warthog Turret placed on an Elephant.

**Game Crashes when unit attacks and/or is attacked**

- This is likely connected to an invalid or incomplete `Damagetype` and/or `Weapontype` being used by one or more units involved in combat when the crash occurrs.

**Unit has no model, but is selectable**

- There is an error in the object's `.vis` that causes it to become invalid, causing no model to appear. Make sure all brackets close properly.
  - Alternatively, the assets that the visual is trying to reach aren't present in your mod's files. This is usually the case when trying to load campaign assets on multiplayer maps. Make sure the files your linking to are indeed in the mod.

**Unit isn't attacking and/or can't be ordered to attack**

- The unit's `.tactics` file is invalid, or your attacks within were not set up properly. Ensure all brackets close properly and that your actions are properly linked to your targetrules.

**Unit is aiming at enemies but not firing.**

- The animation isn't set up properly in the `.vis`. Ensure that the main model also has attack animation entries on it.

**The unit jitters when trying to attack**

- One or more of the unit's Hardpoints within are not set up properly. Ensure the hardpoints in `objects.xml` properly link to model names in the `.vis`, and that they are correctly referenced by weapons in the `.tactics`

**The unit isn't appearing in the circle menu**

- You didn't use `commandenable` in `techs.xml` to allow the unit to appear in the circle menu. Depending on the use case, this can usally be inserted into `unsc_basic`/`cov_basic`, or into a specific leader's leader tech.

**The unit is in the circle menu, but isn't trainable**

- You may have not set up the `enable` properly in `techs.xml`. Ensure its directing to both your unit and the place where it is built.
